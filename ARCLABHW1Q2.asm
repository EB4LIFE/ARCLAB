#Write a program that gets a decimal number (double digits) through the keyboard and finds the sum of all the numbers received so far. 
#When the value 0 is entered, the program stops and prints the sum on the screen. 
#Note: You must verify that the number is between -99 and +99. For the purposes of this program, consider single digit numbers as the same as two digit numbers.
