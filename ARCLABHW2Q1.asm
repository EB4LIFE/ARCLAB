#Topic: Finding the biggest number.
#A data list is given in the data memory. Each data is sized in bytes. The list begins at the address located in the register $a0 and its length is given in register $a1. Assume that the data list is signed. 
#Find the largest number and enter it into register $v0. Display the largest data on your computer screen. 
#Remarks: 
#Each program should be accompanied by a flowchart (and the algorithm of the solution if necessary). 
#Comments in the body of the program are mandatory.
