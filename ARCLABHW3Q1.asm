#Subject: Bubble sorting
#Store a numeric list of data in the data memory. The size of each datum is one word. The
#address of the list should be stored in $a0 and its length in $a1.
#Allow for the data list to be signed.
#Write a program that sorts the list of data by bubble sort. Then print the now sorted list to the
#screen.
#Reminder:
#Bubble Sort is an algorithm that scans the data list and compares each pair of data. If the value
#given on the left is greater than the value of the right, the algorithm will switch them. In each
#scan of the array the largest number "bubbles" to the top of the list.
