#Exercise 2 Detecting Progressions
#Create a numeric list of data where each data is one byte. The address of the list should be
#stored in $a0 and its length should be stored in register $a1.
#Allow for the data list to be signed.
#Write a program that scans the data list and checks whether the data is an arithmetic
#progression or a geometric progression or both or neither (i.e. the list does not constitute a progression at all).
#The program should also print a message about the scan conclusion.
#It should print the initial value of the progression and for an arithmetic progression it should print
#“d = “ followed by the difference between each element. If the list is a geometric progression, it should print “q = “ followed by the quotient.
#If the list does not constitute a progression at all, print “Not a progression”.
